  Group project that started in the middle of January - team work ended in the end of June. After that period I try to develop it myself.

How to run this application?

  Application is configured to work with MSSQL database, but by default it works with in memory DBContext (In memory context is initialized every time application starts), so no configuring should be needed.

  Software is written in c# using many technologies including:
    - .Net Core
    - Asp.Net MVC Core
    - Entity Framework Core
    - Serilog 
    - Asp.Net Identity
